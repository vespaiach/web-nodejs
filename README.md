Want to build a website, it's easy! First, google how to make it, then install some frameworks, libraries or use some helper tools and then a new website is born. There are so many frameworks, libraries, helper tools nowaday and they help me to speed up developing time alot, but what code are inside them? How can they help? Can I make a website without them?

Oh, I've forgotten to ask myself those questions for a while Let's ask now...

# web-nodejs
A website using Nodejs.

# how to run
For development, copy ```.env.template``` to ```.env```, then use yarn to install packages and run website

```
yarn install
yarn dev
```
